# Diffusion Limited Aggregates (DLA) generator app
Application for generating aggregates using the Diffiusion limited aggregation (DLA) method. Various options are available for adjusting the aggregates such as the size of the computational domain, the location of the cluster initialization and the initialization of new random elements, as well as the length of the simulation or the frequency of saving frames. Finally, the application generates an animation of the aggregate's growth, and in parallel calculates the power-law fractal dimension $\alpha$ according to the formula $N(R) = AR^{\alpha}$ where $N(R)$ is the count of the cluster's elements at a distance $R$ from its center.
